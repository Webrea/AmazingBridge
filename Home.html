        <h5 class="four">The four-year project to span the Golden Gate strait and connect San Francisco to Marin County culminated in what was the world's longest (4,200 feet) and tallest suspension bridge when this Bay Area landmark opened in 1937. The Golden Gate would keep those records until the 1960s. The Joseph Strauss Art Deco suspension bridge design is famous today in large part because of something a bit out of the norm in the bridge world: color. Golden Gate was painted "International Orange" partly to match the warm coastal surroundings and also to stand out against the horizon for boaters.</h5>

        <h5 class="four">You don't walk over the Golden Gate Bridge expecting to find a market or a shopping mall up there. But centuries ago, it was common for shops and even houses to stand on the second story of a bridge. The most prominent example that still exists is probably Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy. Rebuilt after a flood in 1345, a 1565 upgrade added a second story to the stone segmental arch bridge spanning the Arno River. It was in the second story that workshops and houses filled the extra space, stretching sometimes wider than the original bridge. Ponte Vecchio is the only one of its kind in Florence that survived World War II.</h5>

It still is. Designed by John A. Roebling and with the construction led by son Washington Roebling and his wife, Emily, the project stands as an enduring symbol for bridge construction the world over. It may have been the 1884 P.T.

But today, from the 15.5-inch diameter cables comprised of 5,434 parallel steel wires, to the towers built of limestone, granite and cement, everything about the Brooklyn Bridge is iconic.</h5>

Opened in 2003, the main span of 1,800 feet rises 105 feet over the Huangpu River and connects the Huangpu and Pudong districts. With six lanes of vehicle traffic and two pedestrian walkways, tourists can enjoy the span just as much as travelers.</h5>

The suspension bridge spans 880 feet between the towers with a total length of 1,260 feet.
